# Python-Project-Dielectron-Collision-Nate-Coad
Working on the Di-electron Collision data set from CERN to produce evidence for the Z boson, using a similar process to the great 2012 achievement of the higgs boson.

This was presented as a final project for a Data Handling and visualisation course. For this reason I have tried my best to Identify loosely what the objects are for someone who isn't tailored from a background of particle physics. To reinstate what has previously been said, This is presented as a demonstration of coding capabilities rather than physics capabalilities. 

About the artist,
I taught myself how to do basic python skills with making a quadratic formula (and simplification) and took a 6 month course that challenged us with weekly coding problems where I learnt more about how to identify and manipulate elements from data sets and lists. In University I am taking a applied data analytics degree with a major in physics. I do not come from a coding degree nor do I aim to portray myself as a software engineer. I am extremely interested in physics and spend every day learning more mathematics and physics to pull myself through the pain of my aspirations. My key interest is general relativity and have been learning that for almost a year. I decided to make this be my project after my lab instructor brought to my attention the beauty of particle physics and how simple (albeit tedious) the problem of proving the existence of the higgs boson is while working from the diphoton collision data set. After unnsucessfully finding the diphoton collision said he informed me that a similar process can be done for the dielectron collision data set to show the existence of the z boson.

I believe this is the data set I used however a similar one can be found from cern itself:
